# Example usage:
nums = [3, 0","To find the missing number in a list of integers containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, you can use the mathematical property of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

By calculating this sum and subtracting the sum of the numbers in the given list, you can find the missing number. This approach ensures a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\).

Here's the Python function to achieve this:

```python

            # Move the start","To find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string, you can use a sliding window approach with a dictionary to keep track of the characters and their indices. This method efficiently finds the longest substring by maintaining a window that expands and contracts as it iterates through the string.

Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def longest_unique_substring(s: str) -> str:
    # Dictionary to store the last positions of each character
    char_index_map = {}
    # Start index of the current window
    start = 0
    # Variable to store the maximum length found
    max_length = 0
    # Variable to store the starting index of the maximum length substring
    max_start = 0

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # If the character is already in the map and its index is within the current window
        if char in char_index_map and char_index_map[char] >= start:

The idea is to build up the solution by solving smaller subproblems and using their solutions to solve larger problems. Specifically, the number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step, because from the (n-1)th step you can take one step to reach the nth step, and from the (n-2)th step you can take two steps to reach the nth step.

### Explanation:

1. **Filtering and Normalizing**: The function first filters out all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string `s` and converts all remaining characters to lowercase. This is done using a list comprehension: `[char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]`.

2. **Palindrome Check**: It then checks if",True,0,0.08889601483941079,1.264512538909912,-0.0,0.2284576537795957,0.9554121595621109,0.418424129486084,0.12147103674122178,0.9925498160871716,0.894023922309959,85500000.52160741,0.9144633074104785,0.0,0.0,200,0.014755212766987253,0.052192899570477624,1.264512538909912,1.0929669980682337,-0.9999927446246147,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.379746835443038,0.0,0.0,-0.0008032225887291133,0.05102471262216568,-0.1594245433807373,0.13753066956996918

char, count = most_frequent_character(s)
print(f""The most frequent character is '{char}' with a count of {count}."")","Certainly! You can achieve this by using Python's `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in the string and then finding the character with the highest count. Here's a function that does that:

```python
from collections import Counter

def most_frequent_character(s):
    if not s:
        return None, 0
    
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    char_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Find the character with the maximum frequency
    most_common_char, max_count = char_count.most_common(1)[0]
    
    return most_common_char, max_count

# Example usage:
s = ""hello world""
char, count = most_frequent_character(s)
print(f""The most frequent character is '{char}' with a count of {count}."")
```

### Explanation:
- **Counter**: This is a dictionary subclass from the `collections` module that helps count hashable objects.

1. The maximum product is obtained by multiplying the three largest numbers in the list.
2. Since the list contains only positive integers, the maximum product is always obtained by multiplying the three largest numbers.

Here's a Python function to achieve this:

```python
