Write a Python function named 'are_sentences_similar' that solves this problem:

Write a python function to check if two sentences are similar. Two sentences are considered similar if one sentence can be obtained by shuffling the words of the other sentence. The comparison should be case-sensitive.

IMPORTANT: The function must be named exactly 'are_sentences_similar' - do not use any other name.<|im_end|>

","def are_sentences_similar(sentence1, sentence2):
    # Split sentences into words
    words1 = sentence1.split()
    words2 = sentence2.split()
    
    # Check if both sentences have the same length
    if len(words1) != len(words2):
        return False
    
    # Sort the words in both sentences
    sorted_words1 = sorted(words1)
    sorted_words2 = sorted(words2)
    
    # Compare the sorted lists of words
    return sorted_words1 == sorted_words2","```python
def are_sentences_similar(sentence1, sentence2):
    # Split sentences into words
    words1 = sentence1.split()
    words2 = sentence2.split()
    
    # Check if both sentences have the same length

    sorted_words1 = sorted(words1)
    sorted_words2 = sorted(words2)
    
    # Compare the sorted lists of words
    return sorted_words1 == sorted_words2
```

This function works as follows:
1. It splits each sentence into a list of words.
2. It checks if both lists have the same length. If not, the sentences cannot be similar, so it returns `False`.
3. It sorts both lists of words.
4. It compares the sorted lists. If they are identical, the sentences are similar, so it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies whether two sentences are similar by checking if they contain the same words in any order.",True,0,0.05445868681584086,1.0084842443466187,-0.0,0.17626113550432554,0.9730880920376096,0.5106280446052551,0.09215463091809305,0.9954359345223508,0.915481103318918,90625000.3454553,0.9475498702377081,1.064368656703404e-09,1.064368656703404e-09,224,0.00849247599964995,0.031067987889274205,1.0084842443466187,1.0559688500769902,-0.9999930134841374,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4066390041493776,0.0,0.0,-0.0010507064871490002,0.051020219922065735,-0.1547982543706894,0.1383623480796814

This function checks if a given string `s` is a valid bracket sequence by using a counter to track the number of unmatched opening brackets. It increments the counter for each opening bracket and decrements it for each closing bracket. If the counter ever becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, and the function returns `False`. Finally, if the counter is zero after processing the entire string, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and the function returns `True`.",False,1,0.0404243026081071,0.9313058853149414,-0.0,0.1454295561925567,0.9816238720620875,0.5350196361541748,0.07173322345458678,0.9966121260944906,0.9219492556867718,92193308.90525739,0.9638288752297043,6.647358153389289e-10,6.647358153389289e-10,269,0.00514565534718568,0.021149755814364006,0.9313058853149414,1.041252486621665,-0.9999931359379708,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4914089347079038,0.0,0.0,-0.0013874294236302376,0.051012177020311356,-0.15256215631961823,0.13773879408836365

This solution uses the ""expand around center"" technique to find the longest palindromic substring efficiently. The `longest_palindromic_substring` function iterates through each character in the string, treating each character (and each pair of consecutive characters) as potential centers of a palindrome. The `expand_around_center` helper function expands outwards from the center as long as the characters on both sides are equal, returning the length of the palindrome found. The main function keeps track of the longest palindrome found and returns it.",False,1,0.030457572414984112,0.8940614461898804,-0.0,0.12722309148090336,0.9862392792125153,0.5476861596107483,0.06218800906164889,0.9974474163274942,0.9250706320692014,94117647.3236178,0.9728315833931654,-1.947864208346099e-10,-1.947864208346099e-10,306,0.0038673484710517246,0.016185715005958307,0.8940614461898804,1.0309261494140334,-0.9999931994216894,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.364,0.0,0.0,0.0001461855135858059,0.051030825823545456,-0.15519246459007263,0.1669360101222992

Write a function that removes duplicates from a sorted list of integers in-place, such that each element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. After removing the duplicates in-place, return the new length of the list.

IMPORTANT: The function must be named exactly 'remove_duplicates' - do not use any other name.<|im_end|>

This function iterates through the sorted list and uses a pointer (`length`) to track the position where the next unique element should be placed. It compares each element with the previous one and updates the list in-place, ensuring that all duplicates are removed while maintaining the relative order of the elements. The function returns the new length of the list after duplicates have been removed.",True,0,0.04916244595494103,1.0584461688995361,-0.0,0.17176636252304045,0.9772169929952478,0.40570321679115295,0.08494073072656078,0.9958798010841041,0.9112939018202849,91457286.82681468,0.9566643053862318,5.990416560340766e-10,5.990416560340766e-10,199,0.007214927736362107,0.029503683294396555,1.0584461688995361,1.0503909686455217,-0.9999930571072065,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.42914979757085026,0.0,0.0,-0.0005207412759773433,0.051028382033109665,-0.1582345813512802,0.14224420487880707

This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of ways to express `n` as a sum of 1, 3, and 4. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to express each number from 0 to `n`. The recurrence relation is based on the fact that the number of ways to express `i` is the sum of the number of ways to express `i-1`, `i-3`, and `i-4`. The base case is initialized to handle the expression of 0, which can be done in exactly one way (using no numbers).",True,0,0.055700056770312714,1.1840882301330566,-0.0,0.18102739455709382,0.9743706853884571,0.5025182962417603,0.08628156845270336,0.9953318979749152,0.900764110748463,90566038.09325118,0.9505960628296595,3.748719797194379e-10,3.748719797194379e-10,318,0.007444509054658536,0.032770917580129726,1.1840882301330566,1.057280512040771,-0.9999930206334816,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.4825174825174825,0.0,0.0,-0.0004564326663967222,0.05102899670600891,-0.13700708746910095,0.16487058997154236

This function uses dynamic programming to determine if the string `s` can be segmented into words from the given dictionary. The `dp` array is used to keep track of whether the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words. The function iterates over each possible end index `i` of the substring and checks if there is a valid segmentation by looking at all possible previous end indices `j`. If `dp[j]` is `True` and `s[j:i]` is a word in the dictionary, then `dp[i]` is set to `True`. Finally, the function returns `dp[n]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` can be segmented.",False,1,0.07030512690544129,1.2415637969970703,-0.0,0.20815565871305128,0.9665109010605977,0.4598754346370697,0.10453166994664698,0.9941078784419471,0.8959472070390615,88275862.55221844,0.9364905578309092,0.0,0.0,290,0.010926870021834739,0.04332877825426428,1.2415637969970703,1.0728354822882595,-0.999992894509743,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.40836012861736337,0.0,0.0,-0.0011283186031505466,0.05101856216788292,-0.16079291701316833,0.1726481318473816

This function uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the input array `nums`. It then uses a min-heap to efficiently find the top `k` elements with the highest frequencies. The heap stores tuples of negative frequencies and their corresponding elements to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq` which is a min-heap by default. Finally, it extracts the top `k` elements from the heap and returns them.",False,1,0.04955650872426995,1.01549232006073,-0.0,0.1787232877088396,0.97714936221618,0.5060640573501587,0.08497040594248238,0.995846775530484,0.914893771557877,92274678.38566163,0.9574312375850432,7.674417782239136e-10,7.674417782239136e-10,233,0.007219969886030245,0.03194201356945666,1.01549232006073,1.0508049701854436,-0.9999930436519082,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.3991228070175439,0.0,0.0,0.00017175560060422868,0.05103075131773949,-0.16368430852890015,0.13787798583507538

This function uses dynamic programming to find the minimum path sum in a matrix. It initializes a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`. The function then fills this table by considering the minimum path sums from the top and left cells, adding the current cell's cost. Finally, it returns the value in the bottom-right corner of the DP table, which represents the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of the matrix.",True,0,0.044276588903092905,1.0633227825164795,-0.0,0.15794926274704135,0.9787031240153529,0.41668936610221863,0.08319661303880498,0.9962892742609819,0.9108852033158169,91842900.65584657,0.9584614662425396,-1.800744555147753e-10,-1.800744555147753e-10,331,0.0069216764211286535,0.02494796960233391,1.0633227825164795,1.045271425386737,-0.9999930914435142,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.43772241992882566,0.0,0.0,-0.00026409878046251833,0.05103035643696785,-0.1257598102092743,0.1520581692457199

This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps.

The function fills this table by considering substrings of increasing lengths and updating the table based on whether the characters at the current ends of the substring match. Finally, it returns the value in `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string.",True,0,0.03552032929936839,1.0567337274551392,-0.0,0.15424410399051636,0.9826438269466934,0.4422782361507416,0.07954954525288055,0.9970231175559154,0.9114374178566759,94300518.345237,0.9672548672078187,-1.5441617817458712e-10,-1.5441617817458712e-10,386,0.006328130149940091,0.02379124361583722,1.0567337274551392,1.0361587122946097,-0.9999931312595625,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.4455128205128205,0.0,0.0,-0.00036704805097542703,0.051029715687036514,-0.15328343212604523,0.16684405505657196

This function `prime_factors` calculates the number of distinct prime factors of a given integer `n`. It uses a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime. The function iterates over possible factors, starting with 2, and then checks odd numbers up to the square root of `n`. It uses a set to store distinct prime factors, ensuring each prime factor is counted only once. Finally, it returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct prime factors.",True,0,0.03905375990206781,1.3012053966522217,-0.0,0.1558460281237788,0.9805677766385286,0.35490095615386963,0.08273899556400673,0.9967269883325652,0.8909487727775385,93206522.01988259,0.9627100709501816,8.098457170569378e-10,8.098457170569378e-10,368,0.006845741386940725,0.024287984481957653,1.3012053966522217,1.0398263831120933,-0.9999931054594724,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4548494983277592,0.0,0.0,-0.00036121191806159914,0.051029760390520096,-0.1500703990459442,0.16205467283725739

Write a Python function named 'anagramMappings' that solves this problem:

Write a python function that takes two lists as inputs. The first list contains unique integers, and the second list contains integers that are anagrams of the first list. The function should return a list where each element is the index of the anagram of the corresponding element from the first list in the second list.

","def anagramMappings(A, B):
    # Create a dictionary to map values in B to their indices
    index_map = {value: index for index, value in enumerate(B)}
    
    # Create the result list by mapping each value in A to its anagram's index in B
    result = [index_map[value] for value in A]
    
    return result","```python
def anagramMappings(A, B):
    # Create a dictionary to map values in B to their indices
    index_map = {value: index for index, value in enumerate(B)}
    
    # Create the result list by mapping each value in A to its anagram's index in B
    result = [index_map[value] for value in A]
    
    return result
```

This function works as follows:
1. It creates a dictionary `index_map` that maps each integer in the second list `B` to its index.
2. It then constructs the result list by iterating over each integer in the first list `A` and using the `index_map` to find the corresponding index of its anagram in `B`.
3. Finally, it returns the result list. 

This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the lists, since both dictionary creation and list comprehension operations are linear in terms of the number of elements.",False,1,0.06437245567449543,1.0224101543426514,-0.0,0.18521359072996518,0.9687483424775338,0.43843668699264526,0.09650394660763018,0.9946050828649433,0.9143140027372849,88516746.81959687,0.9382690725999586,8.555690637615879e-10,8.555690637615879e-10,209,0.009313011710848336,0.034304074191087046,1.0224101543426514,1.066489544880032,-0.9999929655111578,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,-0.0009572329581715167,0.051022060215473175,-0.15571343898773193,0.14334818720817566

This function uses the Catalan number formula to count the number of valid parentheses strings of length `n`. The Catalan number \( C_n \) is given by:

\[ C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} \]

This formula directly computes the number of ways to correctly nest `n` pairs of parentheses. The function first checks if `n` is even because a valid parentheses string must have an even length. If `n` is odd, it returns 0 immediately.

This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum deletion cost to make two strings equal. The `dp` table stores the minimum cost for making the substrings `s1[0:i]` and `s2[0:j]` equal. If the characters `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]` are the same, no additional cost is incurred, and the value is taken from `dp[i-1][j-1]`. Otherwise, the minimum cost is calculated by considering the cost of deleting either character. The final result is found in `dp[m][n]`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.",False,1,0.06964277865763925,1.0837056636810303,-0.0,0.20411504310213635,0.966772661784154,0.38079604506492615,0.10356630022514728,0.9941633884248117,0.9091769578604547,88346883.89997303,0.9368744261542633,1.2922416211466802e-09,1.2922416211466802e-09,369,0.010725978542325341,0.041662950820586984,1.0837056636810303,1.072125126863691,-0.9999929054319697,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.3862815884476535,0.0,0.0,-0.0002097591495839879,0.05103060603141785,-0.1371072381734848,0.13221727311611176

It handles both positive and negative integers by converting negative multiplication problems into positive ones. The base case is when `b` is 0, in which case the product is 0. The recursive case adds `a` to the result of `rec_product(a, b - 1)`, effectively building up the product through repeated addition.",True,0,0.03462388498527948,0.944622278213501,-0.0,0.13969507160450229,0.9832544573972057,0.5,0.07204154293913458,0.9970982466268826,0.92083323742286,93645485.25717902,0.9669540891280541,5.980399141343541e-10,5.980399141343541e-10,299,0.005189983909051172,0.019514713030587022,0.944622278213501,1.0352302699190994,-0.9999931590214222,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.42060085836909866,0.0,0.0,-0.0007871508714742959,0.05102496221661568,-0.16804246604442596,0.15542683005332947

Write a Python function named 'next_perfect_square' that solves this problem:

Write a function to check if a number is a perfect square and then find the next perfect square after it.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2) but 2, 3, and 14 are not.

This function first checks if the given number `n` is a perfect square by taking its integer square root and squaring it again to see if it matches `n`. If it does not match, the function returns `None`, indicating that `n` is not a perfect square. If `n` is a perfect square, the function calculates the next perfect square by incrementing the square root by 1 and returning the square of this new value.",False,1,0.06448288934420696,1.0666253566741943,-0.0,0.19055325372800216,0.9699833217711575,0.4067828953266144,0.09425006977380562,0.994595827656473,0.9106084216748718,88938053.52975953,0.9422891168995241,1.3186868313139519e-09,1.3186868313139519e-09,226,0.008883075652367229,0.03631054250632837,1.0666253566741943,1.066607327737659,-0.9999929605859571,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4606299212598425,0.0,0.0,-0.0011730905389413238,0.051017552614212036,-0.149364173412323,0.15534713864326477

2. The product of the two smallest numbers (which could be negative, thus making a positive product) and the largest number.

The function returns the maximum of these two products.

### Explanation:
1. **TreeNode Class**: This is a simple class definition for a node in the binary search tree.
2. **find_modes Function**:
   - It first checks if the root is `None`. If so, it returns an empty list since there are no nodes to process.
   - The `inorder_traversal` helper function performs an inorder traversal of the BST while keeping track of the previous value (`prev_val`), the maximum frequency encountered (`max_count`), the current frequency (`current_count`), and the list of modes (`modes`).
   - During the traversal:

This function checks if any rotation of the input string `s` is a palindrome. It does so by concatenating the string with itself, which allows us to easily check each possible rotation by slicing the concatenated string. The helper function `is_palindrome` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. The main function iterates over each possible rotation and uses the helper function to determine if it is a palindrome. If any rotation is a palindrome, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.",True,0,0.0723571744930348,1.3810975551605225,-0.0,0.20220183306866718,0.9662205608409697,0.46290668845176697,0.09923211450043595,0.9939359007447122,0.884253182709132,87009064.03951626,0.9341248616891326,0.00014033922616088498,7.202978220591012e-10,331,0.009847012548227632,0.04088558129632915,1.3810975551605225,1.0750392520985141,-0.999992902005187,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.4899328859060402,0.0,0.0,-0.0015283258398994803,0.05100814625620842,-0.15047770738601685,0.1296137124300003

This function `merge_sorted_lists` takes two sorted lists as input and merges them into a single sorted list. It uses two pointers to traverse the input lists and appends the smaller element to the merged list at each step. After one of the lists is exhausted, it appends the remaining elements of the other list.

Write a Python function named 'longest_zero_sum_subarray' that solves this problem:

Write a python function that takes an array of integers and returns the length of the longest subarray that sums to 0. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

IMPORTANT: The function must be named exactly 'longest_zero_sum_subarray' - do not use any other name.<|im_end|>

This function uses a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the cumulative sums of the elements as it iterates through the array. If the same sum is encountered again, it indicates that the subarray between these two indices has a sum of zero. The function keeps track of the maximum length of such subarrays and returns it at the end.",True,0,0.07977124419477251,1.2063684463500977,-0.0,0.21805716498756134,0.9612240623544763,0.5132193565368652,0.10925694345007886,0.9933145435002929,0.8988968537208628,87037037.49214639,0.9253006399781616,0.0,0.0,270,0.01193707969205373,0.04754892720241254,1.2063684463500977,1.0830392878111217,-0.9999928335348766,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.43071161048689144,0.0,0.0,-0.0002530123165342957,0.05103040859103203,-0.18351010978221893,0.1419554501771927
