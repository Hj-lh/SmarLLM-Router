### Explanation:

1. **Normalization**: The function first normalizes the input string by removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting all characters to lowercase. This ensures that the palindrome check is case-insensitive and ignores spaces, punctuation, etc.

2. **Palindrome Check**: It then checks if the normalized string reads",1,0.08461668044328689,0.21770197975854236,15.904173063337803,0.9999999985098839,200,1.0,0.0,1.7777777777777777,11,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.75,0.0
14192481277,Write a function to find the missing number in a given list of numbers ranging from 0 to n.,"Certainly! You can find the missing number in a list of numbers ranging from 0 to \( n \) using the mathematical property of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

By calculating this sum and subtracting the sum of the numbers in the list, you can find the missing number. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def find_missing_number(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    array_sum = sum(nums)
    return total_sum - array_sum

nums = [3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5]
